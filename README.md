📌 Projects

🌱 AI Agriculture AssistantDeveloping a RAG-based system to deliver crop disease solutions (e.g., damping-off treatments like Trichoderma) using LangChain, Pinecone, and Google Gemini. Focused on offline deployment and farmer-friendly advice.  
🗣️ SpeechBridgeBuilt an ASR pipeline for transcription, translation, and summarization with NLP techniques.  
📚 Nepali Document SummarizerCreated an NLP app using BERT embeddings and cosine similarity to summarize Nepali documents.  
📈 Stock Price PredictionForecasted stock prices for Nepalese markets using ARIMA and LSTM models.  
😴 Sleep Disorder Risk AnalysisApplied ML to predict sleep disorder risks with high accuracy.

🌟 Current Challenges & Focus

Linking Symptoms to Treatments: Connecting crop disease symptoms to management strategies across diverse PDF formats (e.g., ICAR manuals, KVK guides).
Low-Resource Optimization: Optimizing AI for offline use on low-end devices to support farmers with limited internet.
Farmer-Friendly Outputs: Simplifying complex agricultural data into clear, actionable advice for smallholder farmers.
